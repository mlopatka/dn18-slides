\frametitle{The Morphology of the Web is Changing!}

% hey Data natives! it is absolutely great to be back for another iteration of this conference. 
%My name is Martin Lopatka, I work on Research Engineering and Data Science at Mozilla! 
%I'm here to talk to you about the Biggest data I know of...  The world’s largest shared public resource... The Web.
% So, we at Mozilla, work a bit on the web, we build a web browser, you may have heard of it.. it's called Firefox. 
% And, so as part of that, I'd say a pretty important part of that is knowing a thing or two about the World Wide Web.
% the story i want to talk about today has to do with its shape and a little bit about the technologies that define that shape
% One definition of Morphology is "the study of form and structure without consideration of function"

%This is our first full Internet map with color and other graphing logic. RFC1918 addresses have been hashed into a unique checksum so they do not incorrectly overlap with other routers or hosts. The checksums resolve to the same host each time to be sure that all routes connect correctly. Another bit of code also removed the routing loops that made a rather large mess out of previous maps. The colors were based on Class A allocation of IP space to different registrars in the world.

Popularized by Berners-Lee's book Weaving the Web[32] and a Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, James Hendler, and Ora Lassila,[33] the term Semantic Web describes an evolution of the existing Web in which the network of hyperlinked human-readable web pages is extended by machine-readable metadata about documents and how they are related to each other, enabling automated agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform tasks on behalf of users. This has yet to happen. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that the idea "remains largely unrealized".[34]
